# Pyber_Analysis
### Overview
The main purpose of the analysis was to demonstrate __the differences in fares collection per week among the three city types__ using Data Visualisation.

### Results

As we can see in the Data Frame there is a significant difference between the three city types fare collection.

### Summary
#### Recommendation
1. Rural - As we look at the Data the simple answer is there is not much demand for the rides in the rural areas. However, As we compare it to the Urban fare collection where the number of drivers > number of rides. This reduces the cost per ride for the customer as well as revenue for the driver and the company. Therefore there is a need for __more Drivers in the Rural area__ which is going to reduce the prices per fare and increase the demand.

2. Suburban - I recommend the same action for the suburban region like the Rural as there is less number of drivers which results in high prices for the rides which consequently results in less demand for the rides.

3. Urban - The price per fare in urban is very low which means there is a high number of drivers. However if the number of drivers is going to increase the prices will be insignificant. So my recommendtion for the urban region is __no significant action needed but the number of drivers should be slightly more than the number of rides not much not less__ .
